### Command-Triggered Agentic Workflows

These workflows are triggered by specific "/" commands in issue or pull request comments, allowing for on-demand agentic assistance. Only maintainers or those with write access can trigger these workflows by commenting with the appropriate command.

You can use the "/plan" agent to turn the reports into actionable issues which can then be assigned to the appropriate team members or agents.

- [🔍 Repo Ask](docs/repo-ask.md) - Intelligent research assistant for repository questions and analysis

### Code Improvement Workflows (by analysis, producing report)

These workflows analyze the repository, code, and activity to produce reports, insights, and recommendations for improvements. They do not make any changes to the codebase directly but can be used as input for maintainers to take action.

### Tools & Setup

- **[FFmpeg](workflows/shared/ffmpeg.md)** - Install and use FFmpeg for video/audio processing (extract audio, frames, scene detection, etc.)
- **[sq](workflows/shared/sq.md)** - Install and use `sq` for querying structured data (CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL databases) with jq-like syntax

### Formatting & Reporting

## 🔄 Updating Workflows

Keep your agentic workflows up to date with the latest features and improvements:

```bash
gh extensions upgrade github/gh-aw # Update cli extension
gh aw upgrade  # Upgrade to latest gh aw engine version
gh aw update   # Update added workflows
```

This automatically updates agent files, applies codemods, updates actions versions, and recompiles all workflows.
